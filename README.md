Motion Capture using Pi-Cam,RPi,PIR Sensors, servo motor, VR Camera. Motion detection is done using PIR sensors mounted at three fixed angles over a servo motor. As soon as motion is detected by PIR sensor the images are captured using PiCam. Servo motor is useful to cover a wide angle of motion detection.
